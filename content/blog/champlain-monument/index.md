![The Champlain Monument][monument]

The city council of Orillia, ON [has voted](https://www.huffingtonpost.ca/entry/orillia-samuel-de-champlain-monument_ca_5d224284e4b01b83473898a1) to restore a controversial monument to Samuel de Champlain, the founder of Québec. The statue, which depicts Champlain atop a plinth, flanked at the base by pairs of Indigenous people sitting at the feet of a Jesuit priest on one side and a French fur trader on the other, had been removed for refurbishment in 2015. Orillia wants it back, albeit in a different form. But it's not up to them: Parks Canada, an agency of the federal government, owns the statue and the park where it sat. Given the complaints Parks Canada has received about the monument, as well as the findings of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, released in December 2015, the agency has hesitated to put the statues back. The monument's fate is now in the hands of a committee comprising local and federal government officials, members of the local community, and Indigenous leaders.

The obvious comparison is to the recent controversies over the Confederate monuments in the American South. But Orillia is not Charlottesville, and Samuel de Champlain was not Robert E. Lee. Without some knowledge of the history involved, we can fall victim to simplistic narratives. The American monuments were built for a heinous purpose, long after the Civil War. Their [explicit aim](https://www.heraldsun.com/news/local/counties/durham-county/article167619947.html) was to intimidate the Black population and to legitimize the segregationist policies of the Jim Crow South. The statue of Champlain in Orillia had a different aim and existed in its own, different context.

During the First World War, relations between English and French Canadians were damaged by the Conservative government's passage of the Military Service Act of 1917, which introduced conscription for men aged 20-45. The government felt that they would be unable to maintain the strength of the Canadian Corps and fulfill Canada's commitment to the British war effort without resorting to conscription, as news of conditions in the trenches cooled enthusiasm for voluntary enlistment. The volunteers up to that point had been almost entirely composed of English Canadians, especially British-born Canadians, who felt a strong attachment to the British Empire. And at that time, Canada was not a fully independent country: as a self-governing dominion, its foreign policy was determined by Britain.

French Canadians, on the other hand, felt little attachment to the British Empire. They felt little attachment to France either. What they were becoming attached to was Canada, or a notion of Canada as a separate nation with its own interests, distinct from those of Britain. As a result, they saw little reason to go to Europe to fight an imperialist war against an enemy that did not threaten Canada. When conscription began to be enforced, there was rioting in the streets of Québec City. The riots only ended when the federal government imposed martial law on the province and sent soldiers into Québec city to quell the riot. Gunfire between civilians and soldiers left five civilians dead and more injured. Martial law in Québec was not lifted until the end of the war.

In English Canada, public opinion was strongly on the side of conscription. In the federal election of December 1917, which was fought on the issue of conscription, Borden's Conservative Party, which had been joined by pro-conscription Liberals, was victorious. The Unionist Liberals were almost all in English Canada. The election was also manipulated in various ways to give Unionists an advantage, including by disenfranchising conscientious objectors and allowing soldiers to cast their ballot in whatever district they chose. All of this inflamed the distrust between English and French Canada and fuelled the growing French Canadian nationalism. Its effects would be felt long after the First World War ended a year later.

This was the context the Champlain monument came about in. As the founder of Québec City, Samuel de Champlain was – and is – an iconic figure in French-speaking Canada. His exploration was not limited to the later boundaries of the province of Québec, and one of his journeys took him into what later became Ontario. It was Champlain's 1615 visit to the country of the Wendat, near the present site of Orillia. The occasion for commissioning the monument was the 300th anniversary of this visit.

The committee which commissioned the monument saw Champlain's visit to the future province of Ontario – at that time the lands of the Wendat – as an event which English and French Canada could share in commemorating. One of the two [objectives](https://www.orillia.ca/en/visiting/resources/1925-Champlain-Monument-Unveiling.pdf) of the committee in having the monument built was "the promotion of good feeling between the English and French-speaking people of Ontario and Quebec." This fit right in with the politics of 1925. The Unionist government did not long outlast the war. Many of the pro-conscription Liberals returned to the party, and in the 1921 election, they formed a government under William Lyon MacKenzie King. One of King's aims was to heal the divisions between English and French Canada (Spoiler alert: it didn't work).

But to evaluate the monument fully, we have to look at how these divisions were to be healed. The other objective of the monument committee was to create "a worthy memorial to the great explorer who led the advance guard of white civilisation into Ontario." In other words, the conflict between French and English Canada should recede when placed in the context of what they shared: their white civilization, which brought to Ontario its two great loves: commerce (the fur trader) and religion (the Jesuit). Granted, it wasn't exactly the right religion for Protestant Ontario but it was close enough for a monument.

While the aim of the Champlain monument, namely the promotion of national unity, may have been more laudable than that of the Confederate monuments in the American South,  it is not without problems of its own. But here is where the comparison with the Confederate monuments breaks down: while there is no way to repurpose a monument to a Confederate leader to make it stand for something consistent with current social values, the same is not true of Orillia's Champlain. The career of Samuel de Champlain himself im Canada was one of cooperation with his Indigenous allies on terms of equality, not one of subjugation. Subjugation would happen later.

We should resist the simplistic understanding of the earliest years in Canadian history that paints Europeans as villains and Indigenous peoples as victims. The situation in Champlain's time was far more complicated than that. The power differential between Euopeans and Indigenous peoples was not great, and often not in the favour of Europeans. These circumstances meant that cooperation was the most effective policy. Champlain's life was a study of such cases, the visit to the Wendat being a prime example.

In 1615, New France was nothing more than a struggling colony of a few dozen men in a settlement at Québec. The Saint Lawrence valley, which Québec stands at the lower end of, had for many years been a war zone. The Innu and Omàmiwininiwak, who lived north of the river, had been unable to use it for fear of raids. These raids, which came from the Haudenosaunee Confederacy in modern-day upstate New York, were only halted in 1610 by the military assistance of Champlain to the Omàmiwininiwak and Innu.

With the river now open for business, the Wendat people of the Great Lakes region were now able to participate in trade with the French: furs for European goods, especially those made of iron. The Wendat had been a great trading people for a long time, and the role of intermediary between the French and the peoples of the interior is one they sought actively. But they had a problem of their own: although the Haudenosaunee had stopped their raids on the Saint Lawrence valley, they still harassed the Wendat closer to home, in the Ottawa river valley, which the Wendat had to pass through to get to the French.

The Wendat wanted to pacify the Haudenosaunee so that trade with the Europeans could continue and grow, bringing wealth to the Wendat. Champlain wanted the same: the wealth brought by trade would ensure that his project of colonization could deliver the returns his investors demanded. In addition, he still had hopes of discovering a passage to Asia, which had been the whole point of the voyages which brought the Europeans to North America in the first place. To accomplish this, he called a *tabagie* or feast with representatives from the Wendat and Omàmiwininiwak nations, and they agreed that he would visit their territories and then cooperate to send a large expedition against the Haudenosaunee.

Having missed a rendezvous with his guides, he went across the Canadian shield with only a small retinue of paddlers, until he reached the nations of present-day Ontario. From there he collaborated with the Wendat and Omàmiwininiwak in launching the punitive campaign against the Haudenosaunee. Although he was wounded in battle, the result was a limited success: the raids stopped until about 1640. The wounded Champlain wanted to return to Québec, but his Wendat allies would not allow it: they wanted him to remain among them for the winter and to take part in their councils. This he did: he was treated very well and spent his time observing the land and society of the Wendat.

While there, Champlain also took up a role that would become a common one for the governors of New France: arbiter of disputes between nations. The Wendat had given a Haudenosaunee captive to one of their allies, a leader named Iroquet. Instead of killing the captive, Iroquet and his people set him free. This offended the Wendat, and they sent a warrior to kill the prisoner themselves. Their allies then killed the warrior. This led to a full Wendat raid as a reprisal, in which Iroquet was wounded and forced to give tribute. The result was lingering resentment that risked endangering the alliance. The Wendat asked Champlain to intervene, and he succeeded in restoring peace after giving all involved a good haranguing.

The alliances that Champlain forged with the Wendat and other nations would last in one configuration or another until the fall of New France in 1763. And the role he first played there, as a peacemaker, was carried on by the subsequent governors of New France in their role as *onontio*, father and leader of the allied Indigenous nations.

Samuel de Champlain was a colonist and a warrior. He did strive to bring European settlement, commerce, and religion to Canada. These are things that the Canada of 1925 celebrated, but they are not what the Canada of 2019 feels worthy of celebration. But many of the things that today's Canada wishes to celebrate are to be found in Champlain as well: he was a peacemaker, a bringer of unity between peoples, and a partner to the Indigenous nations of Canada – some of them, at least. Instead of showing Champlain as a conquistador of the North, a revived monument could show him settling the dispute between Iroquet and the Wendat. It would do no violence to history to use the monument to tell that story.
